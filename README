LowCal PHP
======
LowCal PHP is powerful, lightweight, and flexible framework.

LowCal PHP is not meant to be a direct substitute for larger frameworks like CakePHP, Symfony, Zend, etc... Instead, it is built for developers who value performance and ease of use, over bulk, and strict constraints that come with larger frameworks.
